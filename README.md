Evolution of Technology — Past, Present, and Future — Graphical User Interface

## /////////////////////////// — Tech Stack  

Set of technologies used to build a desktop, mobile and web application.  
**The magic of creative spark** is a mixed spicy combination of imagination and the flexibility of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, patterns, servers, UI/UX solutions, software, and tools.

Just like cooking, and  daily life flexibility, in general, the flexibility of programming languages refers to the unexpectedly many ways in which utterings in the language can be used. The flexibility in the design of a program, and technology, is offered through source code — modifying a program's source code adapts the program's design.
